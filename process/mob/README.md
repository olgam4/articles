# Why Pair Programming Is Dead And Being a Mobster is the New Cool

Lately, there definitely a trend of pair programming: just peeking at the most read articles on Medium, and you can't be wrong. I feel like the community is somewhat late and now, we understand more things.

## What is Pair Prog

Commonly called üçê programming, this technique simply consists of working as a pair on a feature. Usually, one person is focused on the system, the project as a whole and how to implement the latter, whilst the other is typing and thinking about details, the lines if you may. It often is a good idea to switch roles: some people only swear by [Pomodoro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) and will recommend switching every 25-30 minutes, but that would deserve an entire article of its own.

I saw some people comparing it to Piano Duos and I liked the idea. Whilst not entirely accurate, it still projects the idea that someone might play the melody and the other could be helping with rythm and bass. Compared to a band, the Piano exists as a single unity and the pair both work on it.

### Why it works

There are a lot of reasons why it works. First, let's gather some facts, shall we?

> An an online survey of pair programmers, 96% of them stated that they enjoyed their work more than when they programmed alone.
> Additionally, 95% of the surveyed programmers stated that they were more confident in their solutions when they pair programmed.
> Pairs spend about 15% more time on programs than individuals.
> However, the resulting code has about 15% fewer defects.

The afore-mentioned Piano duo is also described as the Driver-Navigator metaphor. One person is focused on the "What" and the "How": the Driver. The other is focused on the same "What", but on the "Why" instead: the Navigator. As some say, two heads are better than one. It might have something to do with the pressure to perform or with better splitting the tasks, but it definitely works. Using the ping-pong method, you will work as both the Driver and the Navigator, letting you reset your focus every few minutes.

It also has been used a recruiting-tool. Why? Because it really is a great tool! You can assert what your interviewee thinks in real time and sometimes, even on a real life project. And then, once you've recruited the person, you can even pair people with different skill sets and skill levels to enhance your team productivity and comprehension. How amazing is that?

### Why It don't

So why am I saying that Pair Programming is dead? Well, first, to catch your attention, but also because I do think we found an upgrade. A real problem with Software Engineering usual Processes is that it is way to easy to split tasks and accumulate Work In Progress (WIP). At first, Pair Programming seemed to solve the problem, but it only did solve some of it. Let's imagine having a team of six people working on a project: if they all work on something different, the WIP is enormous. More often than not, it will mean a merging hell once every one is done. Usually, it is recommended not to diverge too far from the `master` branch. Some will say that it shouldn't be further than `1 Day Work`. So let's say you do üçê. You've cut your `WIP` to half. But you still have the same dangers as before. One duo may steer away for too long, whilst the other two are shouting at each other because they've merged something which broke everything...

## So what should i do?

Well...Why not work as a team, but for real? 

MOBSTER

### Why should I?

Walking skeleton

### Its downfalls

At first, it's strange. I feel watched.

My boss says our productivity is falling. Explain that you now have a direct flow.

### Its perks

### During a pandemic

I don't know if you've heard, but the last year has been tainted by a pandemic. Before, you could plug yourself to a tv and have your team gather around it in order to work, but now, how can you do it? Well as most things, nothing beats face-to-face, but there are some wonderful tools to your disposition.
